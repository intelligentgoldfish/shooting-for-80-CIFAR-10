# Code

We're aiming for 80% accuracy or higher on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Tensorflow 2.0.  Current personal best?  75.74%

All code is written using Tensorflow 2.0 and the Keras API.

The various Python notebooks contain all of the above files split into respective labeled cells.  The alternative dataloader isn't necessary for the network, and is simply another experiment with Tensorflow.  Run the cells in order.

Each notebook will be labeled something like as follows, in part for my own sanity:  Dataset, framework (abbreviated, so TF is Tensorflow, PT is Pytorch), regularization type (if used), dropout (if used), optimizer.
